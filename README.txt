Welcome to the Scuffed Pacman Edition!

In this game we use the UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT buttons to move Pacman around and eat the floating
magenta bits laying around the screen. 

The player is locked inside the blue box that Pacman spawns inside and cannot cross through the 
wall boundaries.

The game will randomly spawn between 10-15 bits of food to eat.

Once all pieces of food are eaten, then you have beaten the game. 

The score counter at the top right will update periodically based on how many pieces of food 
you've eaten.

At any time during the game or end screen, you can press SELECT to go back to the home screen.

Press start if you wish to play again once at the home screen.
